### For New Problems:
Before proposing new problems, ensure they:

### Code Style:
- Use consistent formatting (see existing problems)
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful table aliases
- Follow PostgreSQL best practices

## Question or Need Help?

- **Learning SQL**: This repo is for practice, not tutoring. Try the problem first, then review solutions.
- **Schema Issues**: Open an issue if the schema doesn't load properly
- **Clarifications**: Ask questions in GitHub Discussions (if enabled) or open an issue

---

## What We're NOT Looking For

- ❌ Solutions in other SQL dialects (MySQL, SQL Server, etc.) - This is PostgreSQL-specific
- ❌ Homework or interview questions from specific companies
- ❌ Requests to solve your actual work problems
- ❌ Alternative database schemas (we're keeping this schema consistent)
